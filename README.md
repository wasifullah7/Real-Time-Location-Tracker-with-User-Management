This project is a real-time location tracking application that allows users to share and visualize their current locations on a map. Built with a focus on user interactivity, this application enables users to update their names, track distances traveled, and ping their current locations. The real-time updates are facilitated using WebSocket technology, ensuring seamless communication between clients and the server. The map is powered by the Leaflet library, which provides an intuitive interface for viewing user positions.
